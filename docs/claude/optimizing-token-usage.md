# Optimizing Token Usage in Claude Code

Practical strategies for keeping sessions cheap, with concrete side-by-side
examples of what burns tokens vs. what does the same job for a fraction of the
cost.

For background on *why* the loop works this way, see
[how-claude-works.md](how-claude-works.md).

---

## 1. Search with `Grep` / `Glob`, not `Read` or `Bash`

Reading a whole file to find one symbol is the single most common waste.

**Expensive — reads ~2000 lines into context permanently:**

```
Read("src/server/handlers/orders.ts")
```

**Efficient — returns ~5 matched lines:**

```
Grep(pattern="createOrder", glob="**/*.ts", output_mode="content", -n=true)
```

Same applies to file discovery:

**Expensive:**

```
Bash("find . -name '*.yml'")        # dumps every path, no filtering
```

**Efficient:**

```
Glob(pattern="**/*.yml")             # sorted by mtime, structured
```

---

## 2. Read with `offset` / `limit`, not whole files

Once you know the line range, ask only for that range.

**Expensive:**

```
Read("CHANGELOG.md")                 # 8000 lines
```

**Efficient:**

```
Read("CHANGELOG.md", offset=1, limit=80)
```

A `Grep` first to find the relevant line number, then a targeted `Read`, costs
maybe 1/50th of reading the whole file.

---

## 3. Cap output with `head_limit`

`Grep` defaults to 250 lines, but for noisy patterns (e.g. `import`) even that
is too much.

**Expensive:**

```
Grep(pattern="import", type="ts")    # could be thousands of lines
```

**Efficient:**

```
Grep(pattern="import .* from '@/auth'", type="ts", head_limit=20)
```

Tighten the regex *and* cap the output. Both save tokens.

---

## 4. Use subagents for broad exploration

Subagents run their own tool loop and return only a summary. The intermediate
tool results never enter your main transcript.

**Expensive — pollutes main context with every file the search touched:**

```
Grep + Read + Grep + Read + Grep + Read ...   (you, in the main loop)
```

**Efficient — main context only sees the final summary:**

```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="find every place we construct a JWT...")
```

Rule of thumb: if a search will take more than ~3 tool calls, delegate it.

---

## 5. Surgical `Edit` over `Agent` for small changes

Agents are expensive — they re-read context, plan, and verify. For a one-line
change in a known file, that overhead is pure waste.

**Expensive (~60–100k tokens):**

```
Agent(subagent_type="actions-readme-updater", ...)   # re-reads every action.yml
```

**Efficient (~2–5k tokens):**

```
Edit("path/to/action.yml", old="description: foo", new="description: bar")
```

Reserve agents for structural work: add/remove/rename, cross-file refactors,
broad investigations. See the "Token Usage" section in the repo
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

---

## 6. Run independent tool calls in parallel

Each tool call is a round trip. Batching them in one message keeps the
transcript shorter and the wall-clock faster.

**Expensive — three separate turns, each replays the full transcript:**

```
turn 1: Bash("git status")
turn 2: Bash("git diff")
turn 3: Bash("git log -5")
```

**Efficient — one turn, three parallel calls:**

```
turn 1: Bash("git status") + Bash("git diff") + Bash("git log -5")
```

---

## 7. Trust your edits — don't re-read to "verify"

After an `Edit` succeeds, the new content is known. Re-reading the file just to
look at your own change wastes tokens.

**Expensive:**

```
Edit(file, old, new)
Read(file)                           # "let me check it landed"
```

**Efficient:**

```
Edit(file, old, new)                 # the tool result already confirms success
```

Only re-read if you need to see *surrounding* code that the edit changed
indirectly.

---

## 8. Keep `Bash` output tight

Long-running commands (test suites, builds, `git log` without limits) can dump
megabytes of output that stay in context for the rest of the session.

**Expensive:**

```
Bash("npm test")                     # full output, every test name
Bash("git log")                      # full history
```

**Efficient:**

```
Bash("npm test 2>&1 | tail -50")
Bash("git log -10 --oneline")
```

When you only need pass/fail, redirect output and check the exit code.

---

## 9. `/clear` between unrelated tasks

Conversation history is replayed every turn. If you finish one task and start
something completely different, the old context is dead weight.

**Expensive:**

```
[debug auth issue for 30 turns]
[then in same session: "now let's update the README"]
```

The README work pays full cost for all 30 prior auth turns, every turn.

**Efficient:**

```
[debug auth issue for 30 turns]
/clear
[fresh session: "let's update the README"]
```

---

## 10. Mind the prompt cache (5-minute TTL)

The static prefix of your conversation (system prompt, `CLAUDE.md`, early turns)
is cached server-side. Cache hits cost ~10% of normal input tokens. The cache
expires after 5 minutes of inactivity.

**Expensive:** sleep / step away for 6–10 minutes, then resume — full prefix
re-billed at 100%.

**Efficient:** if you must pause briefly, keep it under 5 minutes. If you must
pause longer, commit to a real break (20+ minutes) — one cache miss buys a much
longer wait than spamming 5-minute pauses.

This is why background polling loops should sleep either **<270s** (cache stays
warm) or **>1200s** (amortize the miss). 300s is the worst-of-both choice.

---

## 11. Reference files by path; don't paste content

Pasting a long file into the chat puts it in context twice (once when you
paste, again because it stays in history).

**Expensive:**

```
"Here's the config file: <2000 lines pasted>"
```

**Efficient:**

```
"Look at config/app.yml — focus on the auth section"
```

Claude can `Read` it on demand, optionally with `offset`/`limit`.

---

## 12. Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` lean

Both files are loaded into *every* turn of *every* session. A 500-line
`CLAUDE.md` costs you those 500 lines on every single round trip.

**Expensive:** verbose preferences, long examples, FAQ-style explanations.

**Efficient:** terse rules with a one-line "why". Move long context into
`docs/*.md` files that get read on demand instead of loaded by default.
