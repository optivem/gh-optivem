## Status (2026-05-15)

**Items 1-9 shipped.** Item 10 stays deferred per its own "Lowest priority" footer.

## Goal

Eliminate every `R-MISSING` finding from the retry-coverage audit. After this
plan lands, every external-I/O call site in `gh-optivem`'s Go code is either:

- Wrapped in `shell.RetryWithPolicy` / `shell.RunWithRetry` /
  `shell.RunCaptureWithRetry` / `shell.MustRunWithRetry` /
  `shell.MustRunStdinWithRetry` / `shell.MustRunPostCreate`, OR
- Explicitly documented `R-DOC-OK` (local-only, probe-by-design, or
  intentional fail-silent for offline cases).

No new retry engine is introduced — every item routes through the existing
`internal/shell/retrycore.go` / `internal/shell/ghretry.go`.

## Constraints

- Order matches the audit's "Recommended order of fixes" (incident-correlated
  first, then leverage, then consistency).
- Each item is independently shippable. Items 1 and 2 share a transient
  regex; define it once in `internal/shell/sonarretry.go` (new file) and
  reuse.
- Tests: every wrap that changes a function's failure semantics needs at
  least one new unit test that asserts the retry loop fires on the chosen
  transient pattern and passes through on the chosen hard-fail pattern.
  Mirror the `internal/shell/github_test.go` pattern (table-driven, sleepFn
  stubbed to no-op).

## Items

### 10. Add retry to `internal/config/config.go`'s direct `exec.Command` probes

**Audit ref:** L8, L9.
**Functions:** `realCheckOwnerExists` (line 841), `realCheckProjectExists`
(line 873), `confirmReposExist` (line 936), `CloneShop` (line 1180) — the
`gh api ...` call only —, `latestMetaRelease` (line 1213).

**Change shape:** each currently builds a raw `exec.Command("gh", "api", ...)`
and calls `cmd.Run()` / `cmd.CombinedOutput()`. The minimal-touch fix is to
route each through `shell.RunWithRetry` (or `RunCaptureWithRetry` where
stdout is parsed), reinterpreting the existing "non-zero exit means not
found" classifier into a stderr / output pattern check.

**Caveat:** `internal/config/config.go` currently uses `exec.Command`
directly to suppress stderr on the expected-404 case (line 843, "Stderr is
suppressed so the first 404 doesn't leak when we fall back"). Migrating to
`shell.RunWithRetry` means stderr always lands in the returned error string
— callers need to start matching on the IS-NOT-FOUND wording in the error
instead of the cmd's exit code. This is a behaviour change worth landing in
its own commit, not a one-line swap.

**Lowest priority** in the audit. Defer until after items 1-9 ship and the
failure log has had a few weeks to surface real init-time 5xx incidents
against `gh api users/...` / `gh api orgs/...` / `gh api repos/...`.

---

## Out of scope

- The `gh repo clone` call at `internal/config/config.go:1196`. Audit
  classified as Low; clone has its own protocol-level retries inside the
  git client.
- The `git checkout` call at `internal/config/config.go:1202`. Local-only.
- The `runtime/...` packages. Their gh calls are dispatched from
  long-running agent contexts where retry semantics belong to the agent's
  budget, not to the per-call wrapper. Audit classifies these as
  R-DOC-OK; if a future incident says otherwise, revisit in a separate plan.
- `internal/runner/system.go`'s docker-compose retry (`upOne`'s
  `transientNetRE` + 3-attempt loop). Already R-OK; bash parity lives in
  the shop-side `docker-retry.sh`.

## Verification

After each item lands:

1. `go build ./...` clean.
2. `go test ./...` passes (no test should depend on a wrapper *not* being
   retry-capable).
3. Audit re-run (manual grep) confirms the corresponding R-MISSING entry
   no longer matches. When all items in this plan land, the audit's
   R-MISSING count drops from 16 to 0 and the audit can be re-issued with
   a closing note (mirroring the "2026-05-14: H1-H5 fixed" footer in
   `audits/20260514-silent-external-call-failures.md`).
